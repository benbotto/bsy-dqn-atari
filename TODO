Potentially getting dupes in memory samples (testing ongoing).  May need to use a MaxSegmentTree.
Try cropping the images to remove the scores.
Change no-ops to 30 when training (10 on test).
Log the clipped score so that the output can be compared against OpenAI
  baselines, which only reports the clipped scores.
Store all the test averages along with standard deviation so that a graph can be produced.
