 ' Prioritized experience replay using a SumSegmentTree for prioritized
 ' sampling, and a MinSegmentTree for computing importance sampling (IS)
 ' weights.
 ' Original paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05952.pdf
 ' Description (without IS weights):
 '   https://jaromiru.com/2016/11/07/lets-make-a-dqn-double-learning-and-prioritized-experience-replay/
 ' OpenAI Baselines has an implementation with IS:
 '   https://github.com/openai/baselines/blob/master/baselines/common/segment_tree.py
 ' Parameters come from the Tuned Parameters table in the PER paper (above).
